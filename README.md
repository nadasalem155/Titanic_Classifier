# Titanic_Classifier

This project implements a binary classification model using a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  
It includes information about Titanic passengers such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Pclass (ticket class)  
- Fare  
- Embarked location (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)  
- SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)  
- Parch (number of parents/children aboard)

## Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0) based on available features.

## Model

- Algorithm used: `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`  
- Trained on cleaned and preprocessed data  
- Compared performance with a simple Decision Tree Classifier

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Cross-validation

### Example Output

**Confusion Matrix**

[[99 10]
[19 50]]

**Metrics**

- Accuracy: 0.8371  
- Precision: 0.8333  
- Recall: 0.7246  
- F1 Score: 0.7752  

**Cross-validation Scores**

[0.7640, 0.8202, 0.8315, 0.7921, 0.8531] 
Average Accuracy: 0.8122

## Files Included

- `titanic_random_forest.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full code, preprocessing, training, and evaluation  
- `README.md`: Project overview and details

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model performed better than a single Decision Tree in terms of accuracy. This is because it combines predictions from multiple trees, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.
